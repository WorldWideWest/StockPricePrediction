## General Info

The project will showcase the prediction of Microsoft Stock Price. For this project we will implement RNN (Recurent-Neural-Network). This project will predict prices before COVID-19 crisis, because we will predict the trend of the stock price. And we know that the model can't adjust to spikes. 

## Technologies
* Python 3.7.7 (https://www.python.org/)
